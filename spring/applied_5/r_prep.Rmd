R packages are pre-written collections of code (typically functions and data sets) hosted in a central repository known as CRAN.

Copy and paste the block below into your R console to install a few of the packages we will be using in class

```{r, eval=F}

## We'll install these packages
install.packages(c("tinytex", "dplyr",
                   "ggplot2", "reshape2"))

## Install tinytex
tinytex::install_tinytex()

```
