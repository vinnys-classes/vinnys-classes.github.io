Please note that you are fully allowed (encouraged even!) to visit during office hours to talk about the required reading if you'd like. I'm glad to chat about it and discuss any questions you might have. Also please note that I'd like you to understand the broad strokes of the paper/what the author is getting at. I will avoid quizzing you over the nitty-gritty details.

# Coding 
My goal is to include the R code that I use to make different graphs, expamples, etc..., for the course. Most of it will be more advanced than what I will teach you or that you need but I want you to have access to examples if you'd like.

Please go [here](coding.html).
