I'm glad to chat about it and discuss any questions you might have. Also please note that I'd like you to understand the broad strokes of the paper/what the author is getting at.

# Coding 
My goal is to include the R code that I use to make different graphs, expamples, etc..., for the course. Most of it will be more advanced than what I will teach you or that you need but I want you to have access to examples if you'd like.

Please go [here](coding.html).
