The main point of this is to introduce you to correlation matrices and heatmaps in R

```{r}
#load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2) #install.packages('reshape2)

#read in the data
colleges <- read.csv("https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Colleges2019_Complete.csv")

#and look at the first few rows
head(colleges)
```



```{r}

cor(colleges$Debt_median,   #this is pearson's correaltion (the default)
    colleges$Salary10yr_median)


cor(colleges$Debt_median,  
    colleges$Salary10yr_median,
    method = "spearman")  #this is spearman's correaltion


ggplot(data = colleges,  #standard scatter plot from previous labs
       aes(x = Debt_median,
           y = Salary10yr_median)) +
  geom_point()
```



# more advanced coding
We can find a matrix of correlations for multiple variables at once. Note that a variable will be perfectly correlated with itself (correlation = 1)
```{r}
univ <- colleges[, c(19:23)] #grab a subset of the data made up of numeric vars.
head(univ) #and look at the first few rows

cor(univ) #calculate the correlation MATRIX. Note the code changed only in that
          #we fed it a data frame from the beginning and not two seperate
          #numeric vectors (like we did in the previous example)

round(cor(univ),
      digits = 3) #the table is hard to read so let's use the round() function
                    #to make it a bit more manageble. I like either 2 or 3 
                    #decimal places myself, purely personal taste thing
```
