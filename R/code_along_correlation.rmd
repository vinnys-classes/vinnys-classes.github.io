The main point of this is to introduce you to correlation matrices and heatmaps in R

```{r}
#load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)

#read in the data
colleges <- read.csv("https://remiller1450.github.io/data/Colleges2019_Complete.csv")

#and look at the first few rows
head(colleges)
```



```{r}

#geom_tile() will be the trick

```
